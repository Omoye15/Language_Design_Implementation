# Language_Design_Implementation
# Custom interpreter for Language Design and Implementation Assessment 2
# Supports:
# - Arithmetic, Booleans, Strings
# - Variable Assignment and print()
#  How to Run the Interpreter

# Option 1: Run from terminal (your system)

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 /Users/omoyeesangbedo/Documents/GitHub/Language_Design_Implementation/interpreter.py examples/stage4_test.txt
```

This is how the interpreter is executed locally on macOS. Adjust the path if you're using a different location or system.
Make sure Python **3.10+** is installed, and the test file is in the correct location.
